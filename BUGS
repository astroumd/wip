this works:
wip test.wip -e wipcmd  arg1

but this doesn't seem to be able to enter a command argument with whitespace
wip test.wip -e wipcmd  "arg1a arg1b"


Some items for the future:
--------------------------

1) wip uses homebrewn routines to read miriad and fits files. these have proven
   to be fragile and the cause of numerous problems. they should ideally by default
   be using the miriad and cfitsio library (though a fallback would be nice to have).

2) pyWIP: python-to-wip interface. there are already some python pgplot interfaces.

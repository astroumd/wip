In this directory we save user contributed code. They are not
supported as well as wip itself, but we will do our best in
maintaining compatibility alongside wip's developements.

Current examples:

	feiling		Chin Fei's interface to libwip.a


pie_chart.wip	Robert Gruendl's macros to aid in pie chart building
mwp_macros.wip  Marc Pound's library of useful WIP macros (include log errorbars)

This Appendix presents, alphabetically, each of the current command names
along with a description of the arguments to each command.
Each entry in this file is equivalent to
requesting help\index{Help} with the command
{\tt help cmd}\index{Help!commands!{\tt help}}
where {\tt cmd} is the command name.
Command arguments inside square brackets are optional parameters;
the description will describe what value will be substituted if these
arguments are not supplied.

If there is a difference between the descriptions that follow and
the corresponding on-line version,
the on-line help message should be assumed to be correct.

<H1>WIP Version 1.3 Changes</H1>

This version has introduced two new concepts to WIP:

<OL>
  <LI> Multiple image formats are now acceptable.  WIP silently probes the
     image type and if an appropriate type is found, the image is loaded.
     As a result, more image formats may be easily added by mimicing the
     call format of the other image drivers.  Additionally, the image
     driver code is isolated from the rest of WIP such that drivers may
     be skipped if a particular site does not want to support it.

  <LI> The addition of the commands NEW, FREE, and ECHO.  These commands
     allow the user to define new user variables, release them, and
     print their current value.  These commands have come as a result of
     modifying the command SET to allow more than 3 operational arguments.
     Now, SET works somewhat like a TI calculator (but with Left-to-Right
     precedence only).

<P>
     As a result of this change, WIP is now NOT backward compatible with
     macros that used functions.  As an example, if the user had the command:
       <CODE>set \0 \0 abs</CODE>
     (s)he should change it to the following:
       <CODE>set \0 abs(\0)</CODE>
     The advantage of this syntax (as well as the TI format) is that
     many of the macros that were multilined due to multiple SET
     commands may now be reduced in size and should become more readable.
</P>

<P>
     Additionally, the NEW and FREE commands allow macros to define local
     scope variables.  This should reduce the likelyhood of crosstalk
     between user variables.
</P>

<P>
     The command ECHO permits the user to display the result of a SET-like
     expression (or value of a user variable) on the work display.
</P>

  <LI> As a result of the modifications to this version, the following
     changes need to be made prior to rebuilding WIP:
     <OL>
       <LI> Remove the current library libwip.a.
       <LI> Remove the obsolete script mir.wip1.
       <LI> Remove the following obsolete files:
         <UL>
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/plot/variable.c
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/sysdepunix/fillinit.c
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/include/arrays.h
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/include/conf.h
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/include/files.h
            <LI> wip/wipsrc/include/plot.h
         </UL>
     </OL>
</OL>

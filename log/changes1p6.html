<H1>WIP Version 1.6 Changes</H1>

This version reflects corrections and enhancements to WIP (Version 1.6):

<OL>
  <LI> The command STRING has changed its meaning.  Before version 1.6,
     STRING set the string variable to the rest of the string.  As of
     version 1.6, there are two methods of setting the value of string
     variable: using the SET and STRING commands.  The SET command sets
     the string to the rest of the of the command line (like the old
     STRING command did) and the STRING command read N words from an
     external file (with a possible starting offset).

  <LI> The commands NEW and FREE have been modified to allow string
     variables to be defined and released.  The syntax for creating
     a string variable is enclose the string variable in double
     quotes (") when declaring it in the NEW command.  String variables
     defined this way and used in other commands (including FREE) do
     not need the quotes.  For example, the following
     <PRE>
       WIP> new "mystring"
       WIP> set mystring some sort of text
       WIP> echo "mystring = " mystring
       WIP> free mystring
     </PRE>
     are legal commands.

  <LI> The command FIT has been added.  Currently, there are two methods
     of fitting the data read by the XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN commands: the
     least squares and median fit methods.  The parameters returned from
     the fit may be assigned to user specified user variables.

  <LI> The commands AITOFF and GLOBE have been added.  The command AITOFF
     converts longitude (X) and latitude (Y) values into coordinates
     useful in Aitoff projections.  The GLOBE command draws a grid
     outline of an Aitoff globe.

  <LI> A new command INITIALIZE permits vector variables to be reset to a
     new value and (filled) size.  Setting the fill size to 0
     effectively empties the vector array.

  <LI> The IF command was modified to permit the LOOP command to be
     executed following a truthful condition.

  <LI> The POINTS command was modified to allow the values from the most
     recent call to PCOLUMN to determine the color of each point.

  <LI> A histogram routine was added as an option to the BIN command which
     permits gaps and reverses in the data to be avoided (MCHW).

  <LI> The command WEDGE was corrected so the user can specify a minimum
     or maximum that agrees with the halftone command.  In addition, the
     overall minimum and maximum may be set to some other value than the
     current image's minimum and maximum.

  <LI> All references (except within #ifdef TEST code) to exit() have
     been replaced by a call to wipexit().  Now all terminal I/O resides
     within sysdep*/inoutput.c.

  <LI> A new breed of function has been added: vector argument functions.
     This function type requires a vector variable name as its only
     argument and acts on the entire variable.  Currently, the only
     function is npts() which returns the number of points currently
     defined in the vector.

  <LI> Routine wippackint() was modified to allow string variables to be
     expanded as well as user variables.

  <LI> The subdirectory /variables has been modified considerably.  This
     was done to break up the user, vectors, and string variables into
     individual routines.  This also involved a split of the respective
     include files.  This should make the individual items more
     compartmental (i.e. C++-like).  This also includes the removal of
     the file wipvarinit.c as it is no longer needed (initialization of
     each type of variable is done whenever a type is accessed for the
     first time).

  <LI> Changed many of the routines from return type void to int where the
     integer returned is now used as a status flag.  This removed many
     of the LOGICAL error parameters passed.  While this may make the
     code a bit less readable, the consistent use of this technique may
     make just as much sense in the long run.

  <LI> Error messages were improved in interact/command.c and plot/set.c.

  <LI> Substantial changes to the manual including a new appendix of
     frequently asked questions and answers.  A new example figure was
     also added which demonstrates how to specify the Hershey symbols
     and their corresponding numbers.
</OL>

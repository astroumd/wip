<H1>WIP Version 2.0 Changes</H1>

This version reflects corrections and enhancements to WIP (Version 2.0):

<OL>
  <LI> Upgraded; requires PGPLOT level 5.0.  This involved changes to the
     calls to the cpg*() routines to use the (new) PGPLOT 5.0 cbindings.
     This also includes the removal of the cpgsrc directory (and the
     cpgsrc.h include file).

  <LI> Modified vectors.c to check for a closing brace; avoids a
     segmentation error.

  <LI> Modified wipmain.c and readinput.c to permit system calls in input
     files; also restricted macro file reader to skip them.

  <LI> Fixed a bug in execute.c which limited the maximum contour level
     array size to one less than the maximum (thanks to Scott Foster).

  <LI> Fixed a bug in aitoff.c which caused the globe to appear rotated
     by 90 degrees.

  <LI> Changed name of mmath.h to wipmath.h and put #ifndef around PI
     declartion as PI may be defined in some math.h include files
     (thanks to Gary Fuller).

  <LI> Changed the name of the first argument of process.c (and declare.h)
     from "inline" to "cmdline" since the former is a gcc reserved word
     (thanks to Gary Fuller).

  <LI> Modified makewip to add the new hosttype i386-linux.  Since
     Linux does not have a Fortran compiler, f77 needs to be defined
     as a shell script which runs f2c.  Also needs to link with the
     f2c libraries (thanks to Gary Fuller).

  <LI> Fixed a few bugs in the gaussian fitting portion of linefit.c.
     The command was expecting "gaussfit" but the help file said
     "gaussian" should be input.  The input now agrees with help file
     (i.e. "gaussian").  Also, the amplitude was always suppose to be
     fit; a bug was trapping the width, not the amplitude.  Also, a
     bug that would cause an infinite loop has been fixed.  The routine
     still has difficulty with input arrays of very large amplitude
     numbers; scaling the numbers on input would help but this would
     impact the input array unless additional storage is reserved.

  <LI> Modified getimage() in image.c to notify user if the requested plane
     number is not in the range [1,NZ] and what plane will be used instead.

  <LI> Modified inoutput.c to use variable arguments eliminating the need
     for more than one wipoutput*() routine.  This meant the addition of
     the stdarg/varargs include files in wipdefs.h.  The other wipoutput*()
     routines have been replaced by calls to wipoutput() and the other
     routines have been removed.

  <LI> Added the command line options '-r' and '-b'.  Both are used only
     when WIP is compiled with the READLINE option.  The '-r' flag can
     be used to suppress the writing of the READLINE history file.  The
     '-b' flag dynamically suppresses the READLINE functionality altogether.
     This required modifications to inoutput.c to reflect the addition
     of the command line options.

  <LI> Removed obsolete commands xlogarithm/ylogarithm (these were replaced
     by the commands "logarithm x" and "logarithm y", respectively).

  <LI> Modified the call to the bar command to permit user specified limits.
     One limit, when present, replaces the box edge as the threshold of
     the bar.  The other replaces the "width" as the mean between
     adjacent points to the user specified value.

  <LI> Modified phard() to set and reset the "hardcopy" variable.

  <LI> Modified wipdevice() to reset the transfer function to the default.
     This fixes a bug that created errors in halftones (fatal in
     PostScript) if the transfer was not set by the user before calling
     the halftone command.

  <LI> Modified lookup function to call new color table interpolating
     routine (PGCTAB.F).

  <LI> Added new function palette to select a color table.  This also
     permits the number of colors to be specified to be used when
     displaying palette.

  <LI> Added new functions bgci and itf to set the text background color
     index and the image transfer function, respectively.

  <LI> Added new variable cursmode which controls the type of rubber band
     drawing function used in cursor mode.

  <LI> Complete rewrite of makewip script removing need for environment
     variables; these values have been changed to command line arguments.
     Also removed "-o file" directive since this should really only be
     used to redirect the final executable.

  <LI> Macros can now be overwritten; this is now the default if someone
     redefines a macro.  A message is sent to the screen when a macro is
     redefined.  Only exact matches are overwritten.

  <LI> Command name errors within macro definitions are now complained about.

  <LI> Wedge command rewritten to use new PGPLOT routine.  It now uses the
     same window positioning as the mtext command.

  <LI> Modified readata.c to allow infinitely large tmp files and changed
     how LINE2 is defined; so if it is 0, it uses the array's maximum size.

  <LI> Added IEEE byte swapping to unpack.c.  This permits images with
     (at least) the Linux and Alpha machines.

  <LI> Modified spool routine to return immediately (don't issure any
     system command) if the print string is empty or is equal to "ignore".

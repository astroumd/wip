<H1>WIP Version 2.1 Changes</H1>

This version reflects corrections and enhancements to WIP (Version 2.1):

<OL>
  <LI> Flipped the sense (direction) of the color palettes.  This will
     affect previously defined scripts but it is better to get the
     correct form now than to confuse others down the road.  The impact
     of this is also seen in the <CODE>wedge</CODE> routine.
     Also added <CODE>palette 0</CODE>
     which is a ramp from the background color to the foreground color.
     This palette is now the default when a new device is chosen.

  <LI> Added the <CODE>beam</CODE> command.  This pointed out the need
     to fix the arc subroutine.  It was drawing incorrectly when an axis
     direction was reversed (eg. X-axis as RA).  Now all angles increase
     counter-clockwise as per documentation and regardless of axis orientation.

  <LI> Added a file in the Examples directory that defines a macro which
     can handle FITS files with the CDx_y matrix (common in HST images).
     This also demonstrates how to specify the transformation matrix for
     images with arbitrary rotation.

  <LI> Added an optional argument to the <CODE>image</CODE> command that
     will permit smoothing of the input image data.

  <LI> Added optional arguments to the <CODE>halftone</CODE> command that
     causes histogram equalization to be performed on the color LUT.  A
     blank value can also be given for the histogram algorithm to ignore
     when computing the data histogram.
     Only the selected subimage is counted.

  <LI> Modified the <CODE>wedge</CODE> command.  This permits user defined
     tick arguments (with <CODE>ticksize</CODE>) to get used.  The change
     also requires the user to provide <CODE>box</CODE> command-like
     arguments if they want a box around their wedge.  Now, if the user
     wishes a label associated with the wedge, they need to do it with a
     separate label command (like <CODE>mtext</CODE>).
     <BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This change of the label argument to a
     box drawing one is not backward compatible.

  <LI> Modified the <CODE>panel</CODE> command to allow a negative third
     argument.  If it is negative, then the panel ordering goes left to
     right and top-down.

  <LI> Modified fits.c driver to permit BITPIX=8 (byte) images.

  <LI> Modified inoutput.c and declare.h to recognize NOVARARGS flag.
     This was added for those systems that don't handle varargs.h properly.

  <LI> Modified error bar routine to permit locations 5 and 6.  Now
     all the checking for proper location values is handled by PGPLOT.

  <LI> Fixed makewip and wipdefs.h for OSF/1 compilations.  It was
     defining alpha but that was used as a variable in some routines.
     Changed alpha definition to OSF.  (I hope this is generic enough.)

  <LI> Added subroutines wip[gs]etcir so the color index range changes
     would directly affect the user variables cmin/cmax.

  <LI> Corrected the way color index ranges are tested in histo.c and
     points.c and how cmin/cmax are initially defined when a device
     is opened.  Histo.c and points.c now get the full color index
     range permitted for the current device rather than the range
     specified by cmin/cmax.  When a new device is opened, cmin/cmax
     are set up to be the same values as internal to PGPLOT (ie. cmin
     is always 16 and cmax, if smaller, is set to 0).  Palette.c was
     also modified to limit the palette range to indices larger than
     (or equal to) 16.

  <LI> Changed sysdepunix directory to just sysdep.  The script makewip
     was modified accordingly.

  <LI> Created a new directory called fit, moved plot/linefit.c into it,
     and then split the individual fitting routines into their own files.
     The script makewip was modified accordingly.  This included the
     addition of two different polynomial fitting routines.

  <LI> Added the command line option "<CODE>-e cmd [args]</CODE>" which
     permits one to issue an initial command.  It is executed after the
     files are read and before the -x option is checked.

  <LI> Added the cyclic palette (option 12).  Thanks to georg@itpgyro1.fzk.de
     for suggesting it.

  <LI> Created a log directory and put the files of changes (like this
     one) in it.  Also converted them to HTML so they could be accessed
     from the WIP home page.

  <LI> Changed the default action of basic images to NOT byte-swap.
     Since basic images are usually created locally, they are probably
     stored in the native format.  However, I also added the ability
     for users to override this default by specifying the image type
     with an upper case letter.

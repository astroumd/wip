<H1>WIP Version 2.4 Changes</H1>

This version reflects corrections and enhancements to WIP (Version 2.4):

<OL>

  <LI> More string space for long lines (8192) - pjt

  <LI> gaussian fits are different now: the ~ is used to fix a value,
       thus enabling to fit negative velocities. Also, the centroid
       can now also be fit (previously was hardcoded not to...) - pjt

  <LI> Compilation on VMS is now no longer checked. - pjt

  <LI> Images are now checked on the CD matrix, if CDELTs are missing - pjt

  <LI> Can now handle up to 100 variables, instead of 20. Arguments 	
	in macros can now be up to 100, instead of 10. - pjt

  <LI> Some changes to miriad.c to fix linux bugs, some remained oddity left
       in 2.3.1 that have to do with mask files.  - pjt

  <LI> Added a MAIN__ and MAIN_ routine for Linux machines in wipmain.c to
     suppress the warning message caused by the mix of Fortran and C.
     If it ever reaches that routine (it should not), WIP exits with
     a warning.

  <LI> Added a warning to the data reader (<CODE>wipreadcol()</CODE>)
     so the user is notified when the number of points to be read is
     truncated to the internal array maximum.

  <LI> Added a check for and removal of any include file TRUE/FALSE
     definitions.  Apparently, some gcc (under Linux) compilers
     (incorrectly) define these variables.

  <LI> Used an #ifdef to temporarily remove the Debug code in heq.c.
     This block should remain removed until PGPLOT 5.1.0 code is the
     earliest version required by WIP.  WIP should also be generalized
     so that this second device could be specified by the user.

  <LI> Changed the makewip script to reflect more modern fortran (g77)
	compilers for linux these days; also documented example of
	usage of ccmalloc leak detector.

  </OL>
